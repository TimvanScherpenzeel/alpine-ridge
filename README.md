# Spars

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spars.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/spars)

ðŸŒ² A general toolkit for creating interactive web experiences.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
 $ npm install spars
```

## Statement

`Spars` is not a framework but a minimalistic toolkit with a strong focus on creating progressivily enhanced interactive experiences on a wide range of consumer devices. The goal of the toolkit is to empower the developer to focus on the creative process and less on implementation details, repetitive work and browser specific workarounds. The components in the core of the library are things you will likely need when developing an interactive experience, handle edge-cases (like vendor prefixing, experimental feature support testing and fallbacks) or are things that should inspire the developer to make use of more advanced optimisations that one normally does not have the time to implement and test under short deadlines.

## API

I'm well aware that the library is currently lacking a lot of documentation you would need to get started. I'm planning to improve the quality of the documentation over time but for now I would like to point you to the [examples](/examples/index.js) and the [index](/src/index.ts) of the project.

### Analytics

Contains a code snippet to help you set up Google Analytics tracking and reporting of individual events. The reporting of events are optionally throttled using requestIdleCallback which guarantees no interference with higher priority code.

### Audio

Contains an audio manager to help you manage multiple audio sources (play, pause, mute, unmute, fade-in, fade-out, etc..). It also has utility functions to check if the audio context has been unlocked through user interaction and otherwise a transparent interaction layer is put on top of the page to unlock it.

### Caching

Contains code to set up persistent caching using `IndexedDB` and with an in-memory `Map` cache as fallback.

### Constants

Contains constant values used inside of the library and offers a forward compatible way of handling changes of these constants (such as event names or cookie names).

### Cookies

Contains code to help you with getting and setting cookies.

### Data structures

Contains implementations of `Bitfield` and `Deque` data structures.

### Decorators

Contains some commonly used decorators.

### Easings

Contains code to handle all commonly used easings.

### Events

Contains code to handle network connection changes, device orietation changes, document visibility changes and window size changes. It also exposes an `EventEmitter` wrapper around [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt).

### Features

Contains code to check the support of various browser features, test for browser settings and check for certain hardware features.

### Frame scheduler

Contains a scheduler to schedule tasks over multiple frames to avoid dropping below 60 frames per second.

### Frame ticker

Contains code to set up a global `requestAnimationFrame` ticker which fires the `SPARS::FRAME_TICK` event that one can listen to.

### Loaders

Contains code for an `AssetLoader` used for preloading commonly used assets like images, GPU compressed images, bitmaps, audiopacks, binpacks, video, audio, fonts, WebAssembly, JSON, SVG, XML, HTML etc..).

### Polyfills

Contains a fullscreen and pointerlock polyfill that can be used without having to worry about vendor prefixes.

### Scrolling

Contains utility functions for smooth scrolling to certain positions on the page and scrolling to top on page unload.

### Settings

Contains code to parse `?key1=value&key2=value` search queries in the URL to override application wide settings. Useful for toggling settings on any device without requiring special builds.

### Thread pool

A small module to run arbitrary tasks efficiently off of the main thread. The module is heavily based on the [Task Worklet polyfill](https://github.com/developit/task-worklet/) by [Jason Miller](https://github.com/developit).

`Sticky threads` allow you to use re-usable generic `worklets` (modularized web workers) retrieved from a centralized `sticky thread pool`. In order to maximize concurrency and minimize transfer overhead the library distributes work across multiple threads through an implicit data flow graph that is formed based on how the different tasks are linked.

Results from one task can be directly passed into another task but instead of pulling the result of the first task back to the main thread and sending it to the thread running the second task the second task will instead be routed to the thread that already has the first result ready.

### Utilities

Contains some commonly used utilities.

## Browser support

`Spars` supports the latest two versions of `evergreen` browsers (not `Internet Explorer 11` and lower):

- Edge
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Chrome Android
- Safari
- iOS Safari

`Spars` does not include any polyfills. It is recommended to use the [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v3/) service in your application.

## Development
