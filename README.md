# Spars

ðŸŒ² A general toolkit for creating interactive web experiences.

## Statement

`Spars` is not a framework but a minimalistic toolkit with a strong focus on creating progressivily enhanced interactive experiences on a wide range of consumer devices. The goal of the toolkit is to empower the developer to focus on the creative process and less on implementation details, repetitive work and browser specific workarounds. The components in the core of the library are things you will likely need when developing an interactive experience, handle edge-cases (like vendor prefixing, experimental feature support testing and fallbacks) or are things that should inspire the developer to make use of more advanced optimisations that one normally does not have the time to implement and test under short deadlines.

## Roadmap

## Browser support

`Spars` supports the latest two versions of `evergreen` browsers (not `Internet Explorer 11` and lower):

- Edge
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Chrome Android
- Safari
- iOS Safari

`Spars` does not include any polyfills. It is recommended to use the [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v3/) service in your application.

## Development

$ yarn start

$ yarn lint
